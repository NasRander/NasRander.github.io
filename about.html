    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my creative space! I'm Nasreddine Zaimi, a passionate 3D graphics designer and Unity/C# game developer. With a keen eye for detail and a love for digital artistry, I bring virtual worlds to life using Blender, crafting visually immersive experiences. As I delve into the world of web development to expand my skills, I'm excited to merge design and interactivity.
        <br />
        When I'm not pushing pixels and code, you can find me immersed in the world of video games. Gaming isn't just a hobby for me, it's a constant source of inspiration and a driving force behind my commitment to creating engaging and memorable digital experiences. <br />

        Join me on this journey of creativity and innovation. Let's explore the limitless possibilities of 3D design, game development, and the ever-evolving landscape of web technology together. Thanks for stopping by.
